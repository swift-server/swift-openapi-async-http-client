A client transport that uses the [HTTPClient](https://swiftpackageindex.com/swift-server/async-http-client/documentation/asynchttpclient/httpclient) type from the [AsyncHTTPClient](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client) library to perform HTTP operations.

Use the transport with client code generated by [Swift OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator).
