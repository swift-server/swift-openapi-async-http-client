# ``OpenAPIAsyncHTTPClient``

Send HTTP requests to the server using the AsyncHTTPClient library. 

## Overview

A client transport that uses the [HTTPClient](https://swift-server.github.io/async-http-client/docs/current/AsyncHTTPClient/Classes/HTTPClient) type from the [AsyncHTTPClient](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client) library to perform HTTP operations.

Use the transport with client code generated by [Swift OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator).

    .upToNextMinor(from: "0.3.0")
),
```

Note that this repository does not have a 1.0 tag yet, so the API is not stable.

Next, in your target, add `OpenAPIAsyncHTTPClient` to your dependencies:

```swift
.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "OpenAPIAsyncHTTPClient", package: "swift-openapi-async-http-client"),
],
```

Then, to get started, check out ``AsyncHTTPClientTransport``.
